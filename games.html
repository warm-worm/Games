    <h2>Introduction to <em>Breath of the Wild</em></h2>
    <p><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (BOTW)</strong> is a groundbreaking action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo. Released on March 3, 2017, for the Nintendo Switch, it takes place in a vast open world where players assume the role of Link, the heroic protagonist. The game is set in the kingdom of Hyrule, which has been devastated by Calamity Ganon. Link awakens from a long slumber to stop Ganon and restore peace to the kingdom. BOTW revolutionized the Zelda series by offering unprecedented freedom of exploration, a dynamic weather system, and a new physics engine that encourages experimentation. With its stunning visuals, immersive world, and innovative gameplay, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> quickly became one of the most acclaimed games of all time.</p>

        <li><strong>Weapons and Durability</strong>: Link can use various weapons, shields, and bows. However, they all degrade over time, so managing inventory and picking up new weapons is important.</li>
